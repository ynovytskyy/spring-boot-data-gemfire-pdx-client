## spring-boot-data-gemfire-pdx-client

This is a sample application to demonstrate (otherwise rather convoluted) connection 
to external GemFire from Spring Boot based Java application to GemFire as a client 
(e.g. not as a peer) using Spring Data abstraction

## Technology stack
- Spring Boot 1.5 w/ Spring 4.3
- Spring Data
- Pivotal GemFire a.k.a. Apache Geode

## TODO
- proper serialization of Java8 Date
- test brings up local GemFire
